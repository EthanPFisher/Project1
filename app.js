//GOOGLE DIRECTIONS API

// ---------Best Practices---------??
//-walking, cycling, driviing directions
//-show direction on map using poly lines (animate to show direction)
//-provide image of what destination looks like as well (street view?)

// URL:
// https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Toronto&destination=Montreal&key=YOUR_API_KEY

//Use DirectionsService object to get JSON of directions
//Use DirectionsRenderer to render rather than doing it ourselves
